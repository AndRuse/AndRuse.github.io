  <p>Hi. I'm Liam Andrews.</p>

  <p>I have a B.A. in Combined Honours English & Cultural Studies and Economics from McMaster University.</p>
  <p>That's a bit of a mouthful, but it basically means I'm great with words AND numbers.</p>
  <p>Take a look around my webpage to see some of my work, or get in touch with me.</p>
